AVIONICS:
---------
In the avionics portion of the build, we are to create the "brain" of the rover. Basically, the rover runs off of a 
controller called a rasberry pi. This device is not just a microcontroller, but a microcomputer. This system can be 
utilized for thousands of tasks. In our case, the rasberry pi will be utilized to pair with a navio2, which will then 
be used to utilize the proportional, integral and derivative system, or PID. 

Through PID, we will be able to create a "waypoint" for the rover so the rasberry pi will navigate and drive the rover 
vs a user having to manual control the rover. An exmaple of this can be seen in the FANUC robots used for industrial purposes.
This is the reassoning behind the precise sanding described in the "HARDWARE" file. Since the rover is being driven via PID, 
a manual driver will not be able to correct the errors caused by friction. 

According to the PID controller, the rover is taking the shortest route to the designated "way point". However,
