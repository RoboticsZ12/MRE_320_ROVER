EXTERNAL_SENSOR:
----------------
One of the crucial components of the project is to decide which external sensor we wish to attach to the rover. 
In our case, the DHT-11 temperature sensor was the best option to utilize. Since the navio2 has a built in temperature
sensor, we can use the external DHT-11 sensor and compare its data from the arduino to the navio2 temperature data. 

This can be compared to a "ground truth" of our phones to read the actual/accurate reading of the temperature. Depending 
the ouput of each sensor, we can determine how accurate and precise each sensor is. 

We attached this sensor by simply placing the arduino controller into main body of the rover, then plugging the HDMI 
input into the rasberry pi. This will trigger the powering of the arduino and the start of reading data.

NOTE: ACTUAL TEMPERATURE WAS 45 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
