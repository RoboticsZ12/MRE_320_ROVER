EXTERNAL_SENSOR:

One of the crucial components of the project is to decide which external sensor we wish to attach to the rover. 
In our case, the DHT-11 temperature sensor was the best option to utilize. Since the navio2 has a built in temperature
sensor, we can use the external DHT-11 sensor and compare its data from the arduino to the navio2 temperature data. 

This can be compared to a "ground truth" of our phones to read the actual reading of the temperature. Depending 
on the ouput of each sensor, we can determine how accurate and precise each sensor is. 

We attached this sensor by simply placing the arduino controller into the main body of the rover, then plugging the HDMI 
input into the rasberry pi. This will trigger the powering of the arduino and the start of reading data.

Keep in mind that we decided not to pair both the DHT-11 sensor with the rasberry pi due to clock interferences. The 
rasberry pi runs on its own internal clock. Whereas the DHT-11 runs on its own internal clock. To ensure both these 
clocks correlate, one simple method could be to simply set a flag variable in the arduino code. This flag can be set 
to trigger whenever the motors of the rover are triggered. 

Although this would be simple, we did not approach the readings this way. Instead, we had the code of the arduino start
reading its data right when power is supplied to the device. Our reasoning for this decision is to acquire a few readings 
of temperature before the arduino and battery begin to heat up causing the readings to be warmer than anticipated. 

Using this mehtod, we can get initial, and final temperature readings. Comparing these two sets of data, we can make a
final estimation of what the temperature in the bay of the rover is at max battery and pi heat.
