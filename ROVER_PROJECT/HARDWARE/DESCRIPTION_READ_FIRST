HARDWARE:
---------
For the hardware portion of the project the description is quite straight forward to understand.
Basically, the only task was to ustilize the guide given by @BrandonHickey to construct the body
and electronics of the rover. 

For the body, wheels, and suspension system, we utilized a 3-D printer to print out all the pieces. 
Since we are utilizing a 3-D printer, there was some margin for error from the printers side. 
Sometimes the printer will leave behind excess resin that will need to be sanded down prior to assembly. 

If these comnponents are not sanded properly, then the rough edges and or excess material will cause a 
frictional force that could produce unexpected outputs. The crucial spot we needed to make sure was 
proficiently sanded, was around the suspension system. 

The suspension system was also 3-D printed is held together my a spring, shock system, that will compress
and stretch depending on the terrain it is encountering. If these components are not sanded properly, as 
stated previously, the "shock system" will grind against the material causing unexpected fiction which will 
cause unexpected and inaccurate movemnets from the designated waypoint.

ELECTRONICS:
------------
The electronic portion of the hardware was quite simple as well. Once agian following the outline provided
by @BrandonHickey, the electronic portion will cover the mojority of what will make the rover run. For example,
installation of motors, battery, on/off switch, rasberry pi, and radios. 

All of these components combined creates the driving/communication component of the rover. As stated previously,
everything was mapped out in the manual provided. The one component that we recommend going off from the manual, 
is to configure the rasberry pi's accelerometer BEFORE attaching to the body of the rover. This is not stated in 
the manual, however, if done the way of the manual, then bolting and unbolting the of the rasberry pi will need to 
be done to configure properly. 

The hardware portion for both electrical and body configurations can be seen in the "HARDWARE_OUTPUT" file.
