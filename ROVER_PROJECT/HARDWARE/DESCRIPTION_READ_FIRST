HARDWARE:
---------
For the hardware portion of the project the description is quite straight forward to understand.
Basically, the only task was to ustilize the guide given by @BrandonHickey to construct the body
and electronics of the rover. 

For the body, wheels, and suspension system, we utilized a 3-D printer to print out all the pieces. 
Since we are utilizing a 3-D printer, there was some margin for error from the printers side. 
Sometimes the printer will leave behind excess resin that will need to be sanded down prior to assembly. 

If these comnponents are not sanded properly, then the rough edges and or excess material will cause a 
frictional force that could produce unexpected outputs. The crucial spot we needed to make sure was 
proficiently sanded, was around the suspension system. 

The suspension system was also 3-D printed is held together my a spring, shock system, that will compress
and stretch depending on the terrain it is encountering. If these components are not sanded properly, as 
stated previously, the "shock system" will grind against the material causing unexpected fiction which will 
cause unexpected and inaccurate movemnets from the designated waypoint. 

The hardware portion can be seen in the "HARDWARE_OUTPUT" file.
