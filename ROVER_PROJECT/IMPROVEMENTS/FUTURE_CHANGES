Below will be a list of improvements that could be utilized when conducting this project. Most improvements are to make the readings 
of the temperature data more accurate so that the readings are not so high. 

1) Utilizing a 3D printed stand that stands approximately 1 foot high, the external sensor could be placed on the stand to ensure that 
the sensor would not read any of the heat being generated within the avionics bay of the rover. 

2) Testing in different climates. Due to the use of Arduino kits for our sensors, we think that hot and cold climates could effect the 
accuracy of the readings from the sensors. If more time, we could test in summer climates for hot temperatures of 90 degrees and higher, 
then fall, and then winter. 
The fall data is already recorded under the "external_sensor" tab. However, if we could test our sensors in these different climates, we 
could also come to general consensus of what climate our sensors measure the best. 

3) Find a way to get the PI out of the avionics bay of the rover. Due to its location within the rover, the PI temperature readings read 
exceptionally high compared to our DHT-11 readings. If we could find a way of extracting the PI from the bay, we could acquire more accurate
data readings that we could compare our DHT-11 data.
