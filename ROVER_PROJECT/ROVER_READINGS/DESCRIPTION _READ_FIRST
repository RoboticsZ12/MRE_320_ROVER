FINAL_READINGS:

The graphs shown in this folder will show what our final data from our last run outputted. The XTrack file will be where the main 
emphasis of the project was centered on. This graph will determine the error from the designated waypoint graph. 

The other graphs shown are simple barometric readings from the PI. A few would be barometric temperature and pressure, and IMU 
temperature. This data is what was used to compare to the DHT-11 readings found in the "EXTERNAL_SENSOR" file. 

Comparing the data from the PI to that of the DHT-11, we could find the temperature the lithium battery outputs and the temperature
the motor drivers output. Due to this temperature, the readings from the PI will be higher than expected.

{NOTE: The temperature when recording the data was 65 degrees F.}
