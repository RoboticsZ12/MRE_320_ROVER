PID_TUNING:
-----------

For the PID tuning configuration, the terrain of the chosen route will become essential for the final output. 
For this project, the terrain of a parking lot was chosen. Below will be the chosen values for the P, proportional,
I, integral, and D, derivative. 

P = 1.5
I = .2
D = 0

As previously stated, these values may differ depending on the construction of the rover, the terrain, and even 
specific code used. These values can, and should be, changed between each run to make the most accurate and efficient 
waypoint mission.
